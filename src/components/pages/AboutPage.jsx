                Camp Kesem is a nationwide non-profit that supports children through and beyond a parentâ€™s cancer, primarily by hosting free, week-long summer camps. All Camp Kesem chapters are lead by student volunteers who plan, organize, and host Friends and Family Days, fundraisers, counselor trainings, and a week of summer camp. This year, we are excited to announce a transition to <b>Kesem at Home</b>, in which we will engage our campers remotely. 
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Here at Camp Kesem at UCLA, we are proud to serve over 260 children from the Greater Los Angeles Area.

                Make the Magic is our annual fundraiser in which we raise funds to support our campers throughout the year. Unfortunately, this year we had to cancel our in-person fundraiser. However, we are excited to host our first ever Virtual Make the Magic!
